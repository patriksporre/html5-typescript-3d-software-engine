 *   Clears the screen to red in the initialize() step and renders a white pixel
 *   at the centre of the canvas on each animation frame.
 * 
 *   All demos follow this interface:
 *     - initialize(blitter): called once after canvas is created
 *     - render(blitter, elapsedTime, deltaTime): called every frame
