    Description:
      HTML entry point for demo 05-flat-scanline.

      This file bootstraps the rendering engine by:
        - Dynamically importing the compiled engine JavaScript (engine.js)
        - Calling the engine's loader() function with:
            1. The compiled demo module path
            2. Desired canvas width (optional)
            3. Desired canvas height (optional)

      The engine handles:
        - Canvas creation and insertion into the DOM
        - Setting up the animation loop
        - Passing control to the demo via initialize() and render()

      Notes:
        - Uses native ES6 module syntax (type="module")
        - No external libraries – pure browser API
        - Canvas is created dynamically; <body> remains empty
        - Keep this file minimal and reusable for all demos
